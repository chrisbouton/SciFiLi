This code was written by Andrew Hall and Chris Bouton for Fall 2018 csc 220 001

We used Binary Trees, Linked Lists, and Arrays to complete the project.

We used a Binary Tree to keep books sorted by Author by using the Author
as what the nodes were sorted by, then each node had a linked list of books sorted alphabetically
by title.

We used LinkedList several places due to its flexibility in length.
We used LinkedLists in the BTNode to keep one authors books sorted by title.
We also had a LinkedList for all the books by title and one for all the books sorted by importance.

The Array was used when we knew the Cardinality of a particular set;
such as when we were returning books and having the ability to choose random indexes
was important to the functionality of that method.
We needed to be able to store a specific known number
of items and pick out specific elements from them.

All the code was written by us unless cited otherwise.
